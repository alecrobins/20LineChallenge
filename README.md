# 20LineChallenge
My submission for the 20 Lines of Javascript Challenge on Challenge Post
(http://20js.challengepost.com/?ref_content=default&ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=portfolio)

I created a photo mosaic that pulls images using the Flickr API to generate a moasic. 
There is a CSS tint over each image in the moasic that corresponds to color of that pixel in the photo. 

Uses 20 lines of javascript + JQuery + some additonal HTML
